"Number of neurons": the number of neurons in the model
"Maximum number of inputs": the maximum number of other neurons/environment inputs that each individual neuron can connect to with a minimum of 1
"Maximum threshold": the maximum threshold to trigger a fire for a neuron
"Maximum strength": the maximum strength of the signal sent as the output of a neuron

Notes:
Each neuron can connect to any other neuron.
Each neuron sends the same output to all neurons that receive input from this neuron.
