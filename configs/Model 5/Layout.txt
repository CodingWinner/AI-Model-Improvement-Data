"Number of neurons": the number of neurons in the model
"Maximum number of inputs": the maximum number of other neurons/environment inputs that each individual neuron can connect to with a minimum of 1
"Maximum threshold": the maximum threshold to trigger a fire for a neuron
"Maximum strength": the maximum strength of the signal sent as the output of a neuron

Notes:
Each neuron can connect to any other neuron.
Each neuron sends the same output to all neurons that receive input from this neuron.
The input for each neuron is multiplied by a unique beta factor ranging from 0.01 to 0.85. This beta factor is different for each neuron and gradually decreases.
For the final output neurons, there is also a beta factor on their outputs.
